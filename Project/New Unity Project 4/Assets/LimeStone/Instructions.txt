LimeStone is a node-based procedural terrain generator  for Unity. 

We recommend you to visit our homepage http://www.lemonspawn.com for video tutorials and general instructions.

Terrains are located under Assets/LimeStone/Data/Terrains, but can be placed anywhere you desire.

To start LimeStone, select Window/LemonSpawn/LimeStone and dock the editor window at a suitable place. 
Right-click to add nodes to the canvas, such as terrain or alpha generators. Click on the header button on each
 node to assemble that particular node (including its children). Again, we strongly encourage you to check out the video tutorials!
